# How a C Program Works?

- Writing the Code: You write the code using a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

- Compilation: The source code is passed to a compiler, which translates the human readable C code into machine code (object code).  
If there are errors, they must be fixed before proceeding.

- Linking: The object code is linked with libraries and other required components to create an executable file.

- Execution: The operating system runs the executable file, and the program performs the specified tasks.
