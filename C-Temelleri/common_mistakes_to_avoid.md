# Common Mistakes to Avoid in C Programming
- Missing Semicolons: Forgetting to end statements with a semicolon (`;`) is a common syntax error.

- Mismatched Braces: Ensure that all opening braces `{` have corresponding closing braces `}`.

- Undefined Variables: Always declare variables before using them to avoid compilation errors.

- Type Mismatches: Be cautious with data types; assigning values of incompatible types can lead to unexpected behavior.

- Divide by Zero: Always check for zero before performing division to prevent runtime errors.
